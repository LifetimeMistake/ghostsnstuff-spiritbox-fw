    "scenario_type": "Trapped/Lost Primary Spirit and Evil Secondary Spirit",
    "scenario_description": "In a dense, mist-shrouded graveyard, a young spirit named Arin drifts aimlessly, haunted by fragmented memories of his life. The fog clings to the ancient headstones, distorting the world in shadows and whispers. Arin struggles to recall the events leading to his untimely death, his memories clouded and incomplete. A darker presence lurks in the graveyard—Vesper, a malevolent spirit who thrives on the confusion and anguish of lost souls. Vesper has latched onto Arin, weaving lies and half-truths to keep him trapped, feeding off his despair and preventing him from moving on to the afterlife. The graveyard itself is a realm caught between life and death, where time moves strangely, and echoes of the past are warped by the mists.",

Vesper's ultimate goal is to sustain this cycle of suffering for as long as possible.",

      "description": "The group must help Arin recover his memories, guiding him through his confusion and despair to discover the truth of his death. Each unlocked memory reveals a piece of the truth. If Arin can confront and accept the reality that Elias caused his death, he can finally find peace, breaking free from Vesper’s grasp. However, if the group fails, Arin will remain trapped in the graveyard, with Vesper continuing to feed on his anguish for eternity."
